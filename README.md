# Drag
Drag is a game created in Processing, which is pretty much Java with some graphics functions. I had knowledge in Java so I created it in using Java conventions for the code. To play, go to the releases for the download, then open in Processing 4. Click and drag to move the ball. After 3 seconds the enemies will start moving. It is an endless game, it doesnt have levels.
