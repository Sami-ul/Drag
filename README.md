# Drag
Drag is a game created in Processing, which is pretty much Java with some graphics functions. I had knowledge in Java so I created it in using Java conventions for the code. To play, go to the GitHub pages and click and drag to move the ball. After 3 seconds the enemies will start moving. It is an endless game, it doesnt have levels.

2. Go to the [releases](https://github.com/Sami-ul/Drag/releases/tag/v1.00.03) and download the zip folder.
3. Unzip on your computer
4. Open `...\Drag-1.00.03\play\Main.pde` in the Processing 4 editor by clicking the File tab on the top. Do NOT open the src as it is separate files and will be hard to open them all in Processing.
