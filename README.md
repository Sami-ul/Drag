# Drag
Drag is a game created in Processing, which is pretty much Java with some graphics functions. I had knowledge in Java so I created it in using Java conventions for the code. To play, go to the GitHub pages and click and drag to move the ball. After 3 seconds the enemies will start moving. It is an endless game, it doesnt have levels.
