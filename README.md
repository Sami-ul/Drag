# Drag
Drag is a game created in Processing, which is pretty much Java with some graphics functions. I had knowledge in Java so I created it in using Java conventions for the code. To play, go to the GitHub pages and click and drag to move the ball. After 3 seconds the enemies will start moving. It is an endless game, it doesnt have levels.
## Setup
1. Go to https://processing.org/download in order to download Processing 4. Set this up and open the editor.
2. Go to the [releases](https://github.com/Sami-ul/Drag/releases/tag/v1.00.01) and download the zip folder.
3. Unzip on your computer
4. Open `...\Drag-1.00.01\play\Main.pde` in the Processing 4 editor by clicking the File tab on the top. Do NOT open the src as it is separate files and will be hard to open them all in Processing.
5. Press the play button in the top left(it is a triangle), and begin playing!
