# Drag
Drag is a game created in Processing, which is pretty much Java with some graphics functions. I had knowledge in Java so I created it in using Java conventions for the code. To play, go to the GitHub pages and click and drag to move the ball. After 3 seconds the enemies will start moving. It is an endless game, it doesnt have levels.
## Setup For Playing
1. Go to the [releases](https://github.com/Sami-ul/Drag/releases/tag/v1.00.04) and download Drag.zip.
2. Unzip it and navigate to the Drag executable.
3. Run and play, the controls are drag to move the player anc press space to slow the enemies, but slowing them costs 20 points.
## Setup For Editing
1. Go to https://processing.org/download in order to download Processing 4. Set this up and open the editor.
2. Go to the [releases](https://github.com/Sami-ul/Drag/releases/tag/v1.00.04) and download the zip folder.
3. Unzip on your computer
4. Open `...\Drag-1.00.04\play\Main.pde` in the Processing 4 editor by clicking the File tab on the top. Do NOT open the src as it is separate files and will be hard to open them all in Processing.
